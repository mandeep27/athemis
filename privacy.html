                        <p>Athemis Aviation prides itself on its discretion. We may need to transfer personal data to flight operators, suppliers or other agents in connection with our services to you but we will never sell the personal data of clients or business contacts to third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
                        <p>We obtain personal information from clients and prospective clients directly, from their own agents or employers, from financial organisations and through recognised intermediaries. We expect that those who communicate with us through the website will have the legal authority to do so and we do not intentionally communicate with children. We undertake to delete immediately the details of any user under the age of 14 where a parent or guardian notifies us that the personal information has inadvertently been released to us.</p>
                        <p>Occasionally we may purchase mailing lists from third party organisations. In such circumstances, we rely on the organisation selling the list to provide accurate details only of individuals who have given their consent for use of their data for marketing purposes. If you are concerned about the use of your data by Athemis Aviation, or wish to exercise your right to obtain a copy of the data we hold, subject to payment of the statutory fee, please contact the Company Secretary.</p>
                        <p>You will deliver personal information to us voluntarily if you call us, if you make a general enquiry through the website or if you respond to a job vacancy notice or email a CV to us. Personal information includes your name and the contact details you provide including your email address and telephone numbers. You may disclose more sensitive personal data relating to your race, religion or medical history if you refer to such matters within an email or as part of your educational history and career details. By providing any of these details to us, you explicitly consent to our using such information as described in this Privacy Policy. If at any point you wish to stop receiving emails from Athemis Aviation, please click the unsubscribe link located in your message.</p>
                        <p>If you make an enquiry with us, your name and contact details will be passed to the Athemis Aviation office or department which we believe will be most relevant for your needs. Athemis Aviation headquarters are located in Delaware but your details may be transferred to Athemis Aviation offices in other countries, including offices outside if appropriate.</p>
                        <p>If you submit a CV electronically or provide personal information in connection with a job application, we may keep this information and any interview notes for a maximum period of one year and your details may be transferred within Athemis Aviation offices to consider you as a potential employee. After this time, data relating to unsuccessful applicants will be destroyed. Please note that we cannot respond to all unsolicited job applications.</p>

                         <li>If we sell or buy a business or a part of a business, when your personal data may need to be disclosed to the seller or buyer</li>
                         <li>If there is a change of control of Athemis Aviation itself,  in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be counted as part of the business to be transferred</li>   
                         <li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply the terms of a legal agreement; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Athemis Aviation, our customers, or others. This may include disclosing information to other companies or advisors for the purposes of fraud protection and reducing credit risk</li> 
                         <li>To enable an IT systems supplier to fix software bugs or develop new features for our customer relationship management systems</li>    
                         <li>To carry out marketing or client care surveys to gain feedback and improve our service to you</li>
